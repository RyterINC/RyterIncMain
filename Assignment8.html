    <p>use case for Alex Solarino, project client.

<div class="summary">
<p>Alex needs a website showcasing his skills as an IT individual. This site will have three main parts to it that will distinguish it as a profile for him, and the rest of
the overall design has been given to me as the designer. Per his discretion, I will check back with him periodically giving him results of my progress in more of an
agile approach.</p>

part one:<br><br>
There will be a "Bio" or Resume section that is going to show off his resume and provide a short biography of himself and desired info that he will provide
me with.<br><br>

part two:"<br><br>
There will be2 a formn "contact" page that will be there so clients can request basic information, as well as quotes from Alex in case of any special jobs they
would like him to perform.<br><br>

Part three:<br><br>
There will be a "Blog" section dedicated to upcoming technologies that Alex will talk about. Being not only an IT proffesional but an enthusiasts, he wants the functionality
of adding blog posts as well as a comments section for people to comment on his reviews.<br><br>
